# Speech-to-Text-Translator-API
This is an API code of a speech to text + a translator to the spoken language.
The algoritim works so that it connects to the IBM cloud AI.
you add a web link to an audio file, which is translated to a dictionary with multiple variables,
from there the code extracts the transcript in english.
The text continues down the pipeline and and is translated to the destination language, again in a dictionary which is again extracted to 
the filltered result and is written to a text file.
